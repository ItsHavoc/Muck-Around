		<br> Fiordland, located in the south western corner of the south island of New Zealand, is home 
		of famous Milford and Doubtful Sounds as well as many world famous walking tracks. Fiordland 
		is one of the most dramatic and beautiful parts of New Zealand and is renowned as a Sightseeing 
		and Walking Capital.This is one of the wettest places in the world and this rain contributes to 
		the area's beauty. Waterfalls tumble down steep mountains to the sea and rain nourishes rich beech 
		forest. Stunning landscapes range from hill country to rugged mountains and lush rainforests. 
		The climate offers summer and ski options providing year round attractions, contrasting with bustling 
		cafes and shopping possibilities, and remote wildernesses and solitude.
